## Assessment Exercise: API-based React Frontend for Uptime.com

Objective: Using Uptime.com’s public API, create a minimal frontend application using React and TypeScript. To complete this task, please create a free trial account at Uptime.com.

### Requirements:

- Login Functionality: Implement a user login feature. Use the following API call for logging in with a username and password: Uptime.com API Auth Login. This endpoint takes an email and login, returning an auth token.

- Display a List of Checks: The application should display a list of checks associated with the user account.

- Edit Check Interface: Implement a simple interface or form that allows users to edit check details (e.g., check name). The functionality doesn’t need to cover all real features but should include basic edit capabilities.

- CORS Handling: Address any CORS issues that arise as part of the solution.

- Component Framework and Styling: Use a component framework of your choice as a base and style the application to resemble the look and feel of Uptime.com.

- Build Pipeline: Use any bundler and build pipeline you prefer, and be prepared to discuss your technology choices.

#### Time Commitment:

- We expect this task to take around 3-4 hours, but please feel free to spend the time you need to best showcase your skills.

### Submission:

Once you’ve completed the exercise, please message me with the link to your project. I will share your submission with the hiring team for review. Following this, you’ll have the opportunity to present your solution to our CTO, Oleksii, and our Senior Engineering Manager, Daniel (who you will directly be reporting to) and discuss your approach.

During the presentation, be prepared to explain:

- Your technology choices and how they benefit the application.

- Challenges encountered, especially with API integration and CORS handling, and how you addressed them.

- Potential next steps or future enhancements for the application.

- Your development and build process, including the tools and frameworks you selected.
